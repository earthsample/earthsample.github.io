 <div class="aboutme"><p><!--         after suffering the loss of a great friend of mine half a decade ago, i fell into deep grief. this first confrontation with mortality brought me to a place of existential exploration. i came to realize my being had a void.<br><br>through university i discovered photoshop and started messing around with it. creation brought me a form of therapy and expression i'd never had before. it served as a remedy of sorts. --> i began creating back in the spring of 2018. this was a turbulent time for me. it was a period where i was recovering from the [-------] of one of my closest friend a year prior. <br><br> during this time i was in university, and discovered photoshop from one of the courses i was enrolled in. i found creation brought an outlet for the grief i was experiencing. <br><br>
     
as time passed i began to gain passion for life again, and have been developing my practice ever since.<br><br>... <br><br>often when i'm out i bring my camera, and take pictures of various objects, natural forms, and textures. <br><br>later on i sort through these images and isolate for parts of them i find interesting. from there i piece my findings together. currently, my works consist of layers of photos i take during my daily life. 
            

        <br><br>this past december i finished a grant program under <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_society" target="_blank"><u>0x society</u></a>, the first physical nft gallery in canada. in september i left my home in toronto to live with my grandfather in montreal where the gallery is based. <br><br> i'll be living with him for the forseeable future.<br><br>
