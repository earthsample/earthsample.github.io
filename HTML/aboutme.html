          <div class="aboutme"><p> after suffering the loss of a great friend of mine half a decade ago, i fell into deep grief. this first confrontation with mortality brought me to a place of looking within and exploring the human condition. i came to realize my life had a lack of meaning.<br><br>through university i discovered photoshop and started messing around with it. creation brought me a form of therapy and expression i'd never had before. it served as a remedy of sorts to my grief.  <br><br>... <br><br>often when i'm out i bring my camera, and take pictures of various objects, natural forms, and textures. <br><br>later on i sort through these images and isolate for parts of them i find interesting. my pieces consist of layers of photos i take during my daily life. 
            

        <br><br>recently i finished a grant program under <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_society" target="_blank"><u>0x society</u></a>, the first physical nft gallery in canada. this past september, i left home in toronto to live with my grandfather in montreal where the gallery is based. <br><br> i'll be living with him for the forseeable future.<br><br>
