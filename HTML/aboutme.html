        <div class="aboutme"><p> my work consists of a methodology which i refer to as 'photograph alchemy'. whenever i'm out i bring my camera, and take pictures of various objects, natural forms, and textures. i think of it as a treasure hunt of sorts. <br><br>i return home and manipulate the photos i have taken, isolating certain parts of them, then layering the parts together. all of my pieces consist solely of photos i take during my daily life. <br><br> growing up as a child, i was never interested in creating art. creating with traditional methods never clicked with me. in art class i was notorious for creating stick figure artworks. <br><br> i started creating art after my best friend took his own life. a gaping void formed within my being, which i filled with consumption of media, games, substances, and philosophy.<br><br> after about a year of this, i had a sort of crisis. i realized i had no purpose, and deeply desired to find meaning. i began to feel an unerving and all encompassing urge to create rather than consume. <br><br>
            through a university course, i became accustomed to photoshop, and began messing around with it. i havnt stopped since. <br><br>
            currently i am an nft artist and grantee under 0x society, the first nft gallery in canada. i left my home in toronto to live with my grandfather in montreal. he was an art collector for the majority of his life, and is eager to pass along his learnings to me. <br><br> thank you for stopping by. i hope you enjoy your time here.</p></div>
