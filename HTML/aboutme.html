<!--            <br><br> growing up as a child, i was never interested in creating art. creating with traditional methods never clicked with me. in art class i was notorious for creating stick figure artworks. <br><br> right before i left to start university, my best friend took his own life. a gaping void formed within my being, which i filled with consumption of media, games, substances, and philosophy.<br><br> after about a year of this, i had a sort of crisis. i realized i had no purpose, and deeply desired to find meaning. i began to feel an unerving and all encompassing urge to create rather than consume. <br><br>-->
<!--            through a university course, i became accustomed to photoshop, and began messing around with it. i havnt stopped since. <br><br>-->
        <br><br>recently i finished a grant program under 0x society. i left home in toronto to live with my grandfather in montreal, where the gallery is based. <br><br>
