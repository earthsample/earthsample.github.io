    <p><b>protest posters | 2019</b><br><br>
        in 2019 i studied abroad in hong kong. during this period pro-democracy protests were exploding, and the city was delving into complete chaos. <br><br>during the day protesters would put up posters throughout the city, with themes of freedom of body and mind, countering oppression, and revolution. at night the posters would be ripped down by ccp riot police. <br><br> each morning after a protest i'd walk around the city and take photos of the remnants. this piece is a collection of around 60 protest posters. i will never forget the feelings of the undue wrath i witnessed during those times.<br><br>  <u><a href="archive.html">↵return</a></u> </p>
