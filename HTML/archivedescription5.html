    <p><b>home now | 2019</b><br><br>
       upon arriving in hong kong, the stark difference of life between my home in ontario and the tropical region were immediately pronounced.<br><br> being constantly surrounded by pure urban density was something i quickly came to fall in love with. <br><br> during the first week i had arrived there, i created 'home now', a piece created through layering and multiplying images of the towering buildings that define the city. <br><br> overjoyed with the change of scene in my life, i plastered 'home now' over the building textures to signify the beginning of a four month experience in my new home. <br><br>  <u><a href="archive.html">↵return</a></u> </p>
