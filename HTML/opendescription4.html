    <p><b>mom's room</b><br><br> in september 2021 i moved to montreal to live with my grandfather. he's had this house since my mother was a child, and hasnt changed a thing about it since the 70's.
         <br><br>i've been living in the same room my mom grew up in. there's a unique feeling of overlapping history that comes from living in this space. <br><br>this piece was created solely with photos i took from within my mom's room.<u><br><br><a href="works.html">↵return</a></u> </p>
